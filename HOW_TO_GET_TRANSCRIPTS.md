# How to Get Transcripts from YouTube Videos

## ✅ Requirements

For the transcript fetcher to work, the YouTube video **MUST** have one of the following:

1. **Manual Captions/Subtitles** - Added by the video creator
2. **Auto-generated Captions** - Generated by YouTube (available on most videos with clear speech)

## 🔍 How to Check if a Video Has Transcripts

### Method 1: Using YouTube Interface
1. Go to the YouTube video page
2. Click on the video player
3. Look for the **"CC"** (Closed Captions) button at the bottom of the player
4. If the button is present and clickable → ✅ Transcripts available
5. If the button is grayed out or missing → ❌ No transcripts

### Method 2: Using YouTube's Transcript Feature
1. Open the YouTube video
2. Click the **"..." (More)** button below the video
3. Click **"Show transcript"**
4. If transcript appears on the right → ✅ Available
5. If option is missing or shows error → ❌ Not available

## 🚨 Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "Rate limit exceeded"

## 💡 Tips

1. **Most English videos have auto-captions** - YouTube generates them automatically
2. **Check CC button first** - Save time by verifying before pasting
3. **Popular channels** - Usually have professional captions
4. **Educational content** - Almost always has transcripts
5. **News channels** - Typically include captions

## 🎯 How YouTube Captions Work

YouTube provides captions in multiple ways:

1. **Creator-uploaded** - High quality, manually added
2. **Auto-generated** - AI-generated from audio (may have errors)
3. **Community contributions** - Volunteers add captions (less common now)

Our app fetches any of these types automatically!

## 🔗 Supported URL Formats

All these formats work:

```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID
https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID
https://www.youtube.com/v/VIDEO_ID
```

Just paste any YouTube URL and we'll extract the video ID automatically.
